 # Assumptions
**Revenue**
* Olist takes a 10% cut on the product price (excl. freight) of each order delivered.
* Olist charges 80 BRL by month per seller.

**Cost**
* In the long term, bad customer experience has business implications: low repeat rate, immediate customer support cost, refunds or unfavorable word of mouth communication. We will assume that we have an estimate measure of the monetary cost for each bad review:

Review_cost
* 1 star	100
* 2 stars	50
* 3 stars	40
* 4 stars	0
* 5 stars	0


IT_cost
* Olist’s total cumulated IT Costs to be proportional to the square-root of the total cumulated number of orders approved.
* The IT department also told you that since the birth of the marketplace, cumulated IT costs have amounted to 500,000 BRL.

# Data Source
The data is public data from the Brazilian E-Commerce data by Olist. The dataset has information of 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018.
